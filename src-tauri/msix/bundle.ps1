.SYNOPSIS
  Combine the per-arch MSIX packages (dist/packages/*.msix) into one .msixbundle.

.DESCRIPTION
  The MSIX equivalent of the old Electron .appxbundle: a single multi-architecture file you
  upload to Partner Center (which signs it). Run the per-arch pack steps first, or just use
  `npm run build-store`, which builds, packs and bundles in one go.
