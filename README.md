If you have a touchscreen can play the piano on screen.
There is an autoplay feature that will show how to play sheet music, it is designed to use letters for notes and currently uses _ for timing and + to play several notes at once. 
Here is some example sheet music in this format:
F4,A4,F4,E4__,F4,A4,E4,D4__,F4,D4,C4__,D4_,A4,G4,D4_, A4,G4,F4,D4___,F4,G4,F4,E4__,E4,G4,E4,C4__,C4,E4,C4,As3___,F2+A2__,G2+As2_,A2+C3__,As2+D3_,C3+E3__,G2+As2+D3__,G2+As2+E3___,F5,A5,F5,E5__,F5,A5,E5,D5__,F5,D5,C5__,D5_,A5,G5,D5_,A5,G5,F5,D5__

## Features to consider
Allow users to upload a MusicXML file or MIDI file that can be used to play the notes.
Show clearly the notes about to be played above the piano using bars and letters.
Allow users to change the delay time so notes/music plays slower and is easier to follow.
Add ready stored tutorial songs for the user to choose from.
When playing several notes at once in autoplay the underscores are not considered seperate for each note. Could make it possible to have one note last longer than another.

## Issues
Will make a popping sound when it has just began playing audio.
Pressing the same note again in autoplay is quicker than playing a different note.
