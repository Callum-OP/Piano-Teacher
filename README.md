If you have a touchscreen can play the piano on screen.
There is an autoplay feature that will show how to play sheet music, it is designed to use letters for notes and currently uses _ for timing and + to play several notes at once. 
Here is some example sheet music in this format:
F4,A4,F4,E4__,F4,A4,E4,D4__,F4,D4,C4__,D4_,A4,G4,D4_, A4,G4,F4,D4___,F4,G4,F4,E4__,E4,G4,E4,C4__,C4,E4,C4,As3___,F2+A2__,G2+As2_,A2+C3__,As2+D3_,C3+E3__,G2+As2+D3__,G2+As2+E3___,F5,A5,F5,E5__,F5,A5,E5,D5__,F5,D5,C5__,D5_,A5,G5,D5_,A5,G5,F5,D5__

## Issues
Will make a popping sound when it has just began playing audio.
